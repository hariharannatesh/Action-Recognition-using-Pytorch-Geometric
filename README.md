This repository is about implementing the paper **Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition** [Arxiv Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07455) using the Pytorch Geometric package. 
A series of experiments will be conducted to test the various methods and to see which method gives the best result. The dataset used is **NTU-60 RGBD**. 

## Experiments 
- [ ] Experiment 1: The sequences are padded along the temporal dimension to a common length.
- [ ] Experiment 2: The data is padded along the feature dimension.
