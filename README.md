This repository is about implementing the paper **Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition** [Arxiv Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07455) using the Pytorch Geometric package. 
A series of experiments will be conducted to test the various methods and to see which method gives the best result. The dataset used is **NTU-60 RGBD**. 

## Experiments 
- [ ] Experiment 1: The sequences are padded along the temporal dimension to a common length.
- [ ] Experiment 2: The data is padded along the feature dimension.


## Packages Used
..* Python (3.6.8)
..* Pytorch (1.6.0)
..* Torch-Geometric (1.6.1)
..* Torch-Cluster (1.5.7)
..* Torch-Scatter (2.0.5)
..* Torch-Sparse (0.6.7)
